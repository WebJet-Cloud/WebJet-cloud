It\'s about creating a website that is both professional and personal, to be able to create a CV, for example. This project does not require any MySQL database or any functionality of a basic MVC framework. The files and folders have a good structure and have been well thought out for each different field of activity, such as: WebDesign, Designer, Webmaster, Copywriter, Marketing and Developer. In general, it is very important that you have a good structure of your files and folders. This way, you can easily find what you need while working on the site and avoid any problems later.',
